          <p>We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them. The concept of Lorem Ipsum was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. design jobs non-competitive. That other text? Sadly, it’s no longer a 10.</p>

          <p>My text is long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my website. It’s about making placeholder text great again. That’s what people want, they want placeholder text to be great again. Lorem Ispum is a choke artist. It chokes!</p>

          <p>We are not keeping up with other websites. I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok?</p>
